# Hi there, I'm Yasmin Hosam ðŸ‘‹


I'm a passionate and self-motivated Android Developer from Cairo, Egypt. I love bringing ideas to life by building modern, user-friendly mobile apps with **Kotlin** and **Firebase**. My focus is on writing clean code and creating applications that provide a great user experience.

As a recent graduate of the prestigious **Digital Egypt Pioneers Program**, I have gained intensive, hands-on experience by building full-featured applications and mastering industry best practices. I am now eager to apply my skills and continue growing in a professional environment.
